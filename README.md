ðŸš˜ Driver Drowsiness Detection | Real-Time Computer Vision Project

Excited to share my latest project â€” a real-time driver drowsiness detection system built using Python, OpenCV, and dlib.

The system uses facial landmark detection to monitor eye aspect ratio (EAR) and detect signs of fatigue. When prolonged eye closure is detected, it triggers an alert to help prevent accidents caused by drowsiness.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used: OpenCV | dlib | Python | NumPy
ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
âœ” Real-time facial landmark tracking
âœ” EAR-based eye closure detection
âœ” Alert system for drowsiness prevention

This project demonstrates how AI can improve road safety and help reduce fatigue-related incidents.
